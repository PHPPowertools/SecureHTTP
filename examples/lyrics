<h1>Baz Luhrmann - Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)</h1>
Ladies and Gentlemen of the class of ’97<br/>
Wear sunscreen.<br/>
If I could offer you only one tip for the future,<br/>
sunscreen would be it.<br/>
The long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists<br/>
whereas the rest of my advice has no basis<br/>
more reliable than my own meandering experience<br/>
I will dispense this advice now.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth;<br/>
oh nevermind; <br/>
you will not understand the power and beauty of your youth<br/>
until they have faded.<br/>
But trust me, in 20 years you’ll look back at photos of yourself<br/>
and recall in a way you can’t grasp now<br/>
how much possibility lay before you<br/>
and how fabulous you really looked.<br/>
You’re not as fat as you imagine.<br/>
<br/>
Don’t worry about the future;<br/>
or worry, but know that worrying is as effective<br/>
as trying to solve an algebra equation<br/>
by chewing bubblegum.<br/>
The real troubles in your life<br/>
are apt to be things that never crossed<br/>
your worried mind;<br/>
the kind that blindside you at 4pm on some idle Tuesday.<br/>
<br/>
Do one thing everyday that scares you<br/>
<br/>
Sing<br/>
Don’t be reckless with other people’s hearts,<br/>
don’t put up with people who are reckless with yours.<br/>
<br/>
Floss<br/>
<br/>
Don’t waste your time on jealousy;<br/>
sometimes you’re ahead,<br/>
sometimes you’re behind<br/>
the race is long, and in the end,<br/>
it’s only with yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Remember the compliments you receive, forget the insults;<br/>
if you succeed in doing this, tell me how.<br/>
<br/>
Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements.<br/>
<br/>
Stretch<br/>
<br/>
Don’t feel guilty if you don’t know what you want to do with your life<br/>
the most interesting people I know didn’t know at 22<br/>
what they wanted to do with their lives,<br/>
some of the most interesting 40 year olds I know still don’t.<br/>
<br/>
Get plenty of calcium.<br/>
Be kind to your knees,<br/>
you’ll miss them when they’re gone.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you’ll marry, maybe you won’t,<br/>
maybe you’ll have children, maybe you won’t,<br/>
maybe you’ll divorce at 40,<br/>
maybe you’ll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary<br/>
what ever you do, don’t congratulate yourself too much <br/>
or berate yourself either<br/>
your choices are half chance, so are everybody else’s.<br/>
Enjoy your body, use it every way you can<br/>
don’t be afraid of it, or what other people think of it,<br/>
it’s the greatest instrument you’ll ever own...<br/>
<br/>
Dance,<br/>
even if you have nowhere to do it but in your own living room.<br/>
<br/>
Read the directions, <br/>
even if you don’t follow them.<br/>
<br/>
Do NOT read beauty magazines, <br/>
they will only make you feel ugly.<br/>
<br/>
Get to know your parents,<br/>
you never know when they’ll be gone for good.<br/>
<br/>
Be nice to your siblings;<br/>
they are the best link to your past <br/>
and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Understand that friends come and go,<br/>
but for the precious few you should hold on.<br/>
Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography in lifestyle<br/>
because the older you get,<br/>
the more you need the people you knew when you were young.<br/>
<br/>
Live in New York City once,<br/>
but leave before it makes you hard;<br/>
live in Northern California once,<br/>
but leave before it makes you soft.<br/>
<br/>
Travel.<br/>
<br/>
Accept certain inalienable truths, prices will rise,<br/>
politicians will philander,<br/>
you too will get old, and when you do you’ll fantasize<br/>
that when you were young prices were reasonable,<br/>
politicians were noble<br/>
and children respected their elders.<br/>
<br/>
Respect your elders.<br/>
<br/>
Don’t expect anyone else to support you.<br/>
Maybe you have a trust fund,<br/>
maybe you have a wealthy spouse;<br/>
but you never know when either one might run out.<br/>
<br/>
Don’t mess too much with your hair,<br/>
or by the time you're 40, it will look 85.<br/>
<br/>
Be careful whose advice you buy,<br/>
but, be patient with those who supply it.<br/>
Advice is a form of nostalgia,<br/>
dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, <br/>
wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts <br/>
and recycling it for more than it’s worth.<br/>
<br/>
But trust me on the sunscreen
